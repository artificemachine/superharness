# superharness — Iteration Log

This document is the full context for any agent (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cowork, or any other LLM) continuing work on superharness. Read this first. It tells you what superharness is, how it got here, and where to push next.

## What Is superharness?

**Your personal harness architecture — the full operating environment that determines whether an AI model's intelligence translates into useful work for you, specifically.**

It is NOT a superpowers clone. It is NOT a skills plugin. It is the name, structure, and portability layer for the harness Maxime Roy has already built organically across the Claude config directory, Codex config directory, the DevOpsCelstn workspace, the Obsidian vault, and his own working patterns.

### Core thesis
Same Claude model scored 78% inside one harness and 42% inside another. Same brain, different body, nearly double the performance. The harness is a performance multiplier, not an optimization layer.

### Key distinction
- **obra/superpowers** = a generic skills plugin anyone installs. Teaches an agent how to work.
- **superharness** = a personal harness architecture. Teaches an agent how to work **with Maxime Roy**.

### Six layers

| # | Layer | What It Solves | State |
|---|-------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | **Identity** | WHO you are — stable context across all projects | Formalized in `identity/developer-profile.md` and `identity/agent-context.md` |
| 2 | **Agents** | WHAT each agent needs — cross-agent config parity | Partially built — `agents/claude-code/` and `agents/codex-cli/` exist but empty |
| 3 | **Routing** | WHERE tasks go — dispatch logic | Described in README, not yet its own doc |
| 4 | **Discipline** | WHEN and HOW LONG — session management | Described in README, not yet its own doc |
| 5 | **Quality** | HOW GOOD — verification gates | Old skill files exist in `skills/` from v0 |
| 6 | **Knowledge** | WHY IT COMPOUNDS — vault deposit/withdrawal | `methodology/harness-thesis.md` written, vault protocol not yet |

## Iteration 0 — The Conversation That Started It All

**Date:** 2026-03-07
**Agent:** Cowork (Claude Opus 4.6)
**Session type:** Extended multi-hour conversation, continued from a previous session

### What happened before superharness

This session began with building two foundational documents for Maxime Roy:

1. **Developer Profile** (`maxime-roy-developer-profile.md`) — A comprehensive, honest assessment of who Maxime is as a developer and entrepreneur. Includes:
   - 15+ years C++/Python/Rust/Solidity
   - 7,000 hours studying crypto, DeFi, staking, lending, TradingView, TFSA, ETF, macroeconomics over 5 years
   - Zimmer Biomet contract (C++/Qt/QML, medical devices)
   - new.blacc as main company entity, Cypher Farms separate (Proxmox infrastructure R&D, partnership)
   - 5-tier venture portfolio (VidDocs, Bear Crypto Club, CapCompare, Phraser, RepoSec)
   - Honest gaps: no shipped SaaS, no revenue, competitive markets
   - Anti-patterns ranked by likelihood: scope creep, over-planning, shiny object syndrome
   - Freedom number: $5K CAD/month intermediate, $12-16K+ full replacement

2. **Agent Context Document** (`maxime-roy-agent-context.md`) — An embeddable CLAUDE.md-style doc that tells any agent how to work with Maxime specifically. Includes routing table, tech stack, session templates, protected files, anti-patterns.

3. **CLAUDE.md Template** (`CLAUDE-md-template.md`) — A generic/reusable template derived from the agent context doc, with HTML comment instructions.

### Key decisions made before superharness
- **Removed Ralph** (autonomous loop driver) from all documents. Reason: bottleneck is shipping, not coding speed. Token costs are real. Never used.
- **Removed @fix_plan.md** references — was Ralph-specific.
- **Added 7,000 hours crypto/finance** — major correction that changed the entire strategic analysis.
- **new.blacc established** as main company entity.
- **Proxmox partnership** clarified — co-operated with a friend.
- **Toned down hyperbole** — "most advanced solo-dev AI harness" replaced with honest assessment.

### The spark for superharness

Maxime shared a vault note: transcript of Nate Herk's YouTube video "Claude Code vs Codex: The Decision That Compounds Every Week You Delay." Key insights absorbed:
- 78% vs 42% benchmark (harness > model)
- Calvin French Owen's workflow: Claude Code for planning, Codex for implementation, cross-agent review
- Compounding skill layers: /commit → /worktree → /implement → /implement-all
- Harness lock-in: switching resets compounding to zero

Maxime then said: **"I want some kind of framework that I can include in my workflow."**

## Iteration 1 — The superpowers Clone (Wrong Direction)

**What was built:** A direct clone of obra/superpowers structure — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `hooks/session-start.sh`, `skills/` directory with 7 SKILL.md files:
- session-routing, cross-agent-review, ship-pipeline, vault-sync, evening-session, weekend-block, harness-engineering

**What was wrong:** This was just superpowers with different content. A skills plugin, not a harness architecture. The user correctly called this out:

> "the goal was not to create a copy of superpowers"

**Lesson:** Skills are ONE component of a harness. The harness is the entire system — identity, agents, routing, discipline, quality, knowledge. Superpowers addresses skills. Superharness addresses everything.

---

## Iteration 2 — Naming the Architecture (Current State)

**What changed:**
1. Deep research into the vault — found the user already has:
   - Full cross-agent parallel setup documented (`codex-claude-parallel.md`)
   - AGENTS.md vs CLAUDE.md compatibility guide (`agents-md-guide.md`)
   - Global CLAUDE.md with model selection decision tree, cost guards (`claude_md_global.md`)
   - Matching slash commands ↔ Codex skills (/ship ↔ ship, /remember ↔ remember, etc.)
   - `goclaude` alias that launches clean sessions (`cd DevOpsCelstn && ./clean_context.sh && claude`)
   - 100+ shell aliases in `.zshrc`
   - Security audit of obra/superpowers in vault

2. Realized: **the harness already exists. It's scattered.** superharness is the framework that gives it a name, a structure, and portability.

3. Defined six layers (Identity, Agents, Routing, Discipline, Quality, Knowledge)

4. Rewrote README as a manifesto — not "here's a plugin" but "here's what your harness IS"

5. Wrote `methodology/harness-thesis.md` — the philosophical core (78% vs 42%, two philosophies, Calvin French Owen pattern, compounding chain, what it means for a solo dev)

6. Created `identity/` directory with developer-profile.md and agent-context.md (copied from workspace)

7. Created `agents/claude-code/` and `agents/codex-cli/` directories (empty — to be populated with global configs)

8. Created `methodology/` directory with harness-thesis.md

9. Created `templates/` directory (empty — for project bootstrap templates)

**What still exists from Iteration 1 (needs cleanup):**
- `skills/` directory with 7 SKILL.md files — these are valid workflow patterns but should be reorganized under `methodology/` or kept as a separate component
- `hooks/session-start.sh` — still useful but needs updating to match new architecture
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — still references old skills-only structure
- `install.sh` — outdated, references old structure

## Open Questions for Next Iteration

1. **Should skills/ stay as a subdirectory?** The skill files have valid content (routing table, ship pipeline, session templates). They could live under `methodology/` as plain markdown, or stay as Claude Code-compatible SKILL.md files. Trade-off: SKILL.md format is directly loadable by Claude Code. Plain markdown is more portable.

2. **What goes in agents/?** The global CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md already exist on the user's machine in their respective config directories. Should superharness contain copies (portable, versionable) or references (single source of truth)?

3. **What goes in templates/?** When Maxime starts a new project, superharness should generate the right CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md. How much is templated vs generated?

4. **How does superharness relate to DevOpsCelstn?** The user's `goclaude` alias points to the DevOpsCelstn directory. Is superharness a subdirectory inside DevOpsCelstn, or is DevOpsCelstn part of the harness?

5. **Cleanup:** The `context/` directory duplicates `identity/`. The old `install.sh` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` reference the iteration 1 structure. These need cleaning.

6. **Vault integration:** The vault protocol (how /remember and /upvault work) is described in the README but not formalized in its own document yet.

7. **Is superharness a git repo?** If yes, it becomes versionable, cloneable, and the compounding thesis becomes literally true — every commit is a deposit. If no, it stays as a local directory structure.

## How to Continue

If you're an agent picking this up:

1. **Read this file first** — you now have full context
2. **Read the README.md** — the manifesto defines what superharness is
3. **Read methodology/harness-thesis.md** — the philosophical core
4. **Check the Open Questions** — pick one and propose a direction
5. **Update this CHANGELOG** — add your iteration at the bottom

The user (Maxime / Rocha) prefers:
- Honest assessment over hype
- "Show before doing" — preview actions, wait for approval
- One task at a time, no context-switching
- Markdown by default unless code is needed
- Vault search before starting any new task (use Obsidian MCP if available)
