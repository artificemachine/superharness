# superharness

**Multi-agent task coordination for Claude Code and Codex CLI**

superharness lets AI coding assistants work on the same project without stepping on each other. It provides a shared contract, queue-based delegation, and handoff/ledger state so tasks survive across sessions.

## Quick Start

> **Requires:** `bash`, `ruby`, `python3`. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for install commands.

### 0. Install the CLI
```bash
bash scripts/install-wrapper.sh
# Creates a symlink at ~/.local/bin/superharness
# If ~/.local/bin is not in PATH: export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### 1. Initialize your project
```bash
cd /path/to/project
superharness init "Project Name" "Tech/Stack" "active"
# Creates .superharness/, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md in your project root
```

### 2. Verify setup
```bash
superharness doctor --project .
```

### 3. Create a task and dispatch it
```bash
superharness task create --project . --id my-task --title "First task" --owner codex-cli
superharness enqueue --project . --to codex-cli --task my-task --priority 1
superharness dispatch --project . --to codex-cli --print-only
```

**Full setup guide:** [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md)

## Core Commands

```bash
# Contract snapshot
superharness contract today --project /path/to/project

# Delegate to agent
superharness delegate --to codex-cli --project /path/to/project

# Queue management
superharness enqueue --project . --to codex-cli --task task-id --priority 1
superharness dispatch --project . --to codex-cli

# Protocol hygiene
superharness hygiene --project /path/to/project

# Browser monitor
superharness monitor-ui --project /path/to/project
```

**Full command reference:** [docs/GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md)

### Run Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -q
```

---

## Prerequisites

- `bash` (scripts are Bash-based)
- `ruby` (required by inbox YAML helpers and hygiene checks) — see `.ruby-version`
- `python3` + `pytest` (tests and hook JSON escaping) — `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `claude` CLI (for Claude delegation commands): `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- `codex` CLI (for Codex delegation commands): `npm install -g @openai/codex`
- macOS `launchd` or Linux `systemd` for background watcher (see `scripts/superharness-watcher@.service`); `--foreground` mode works everywhere

---

## Project Runtime State

Per-project state lives in `.superharness/`:

```text
.superharness/
├── contract.yaml          # tasks, decisions, failures
├── handoffs/              # session handoff state
├── ledger.md              # append-only event log
├── decisions.yaml         # cross-agent ADRs
├── failures.yaml          # failure memory
└── inbox.yaml             # dispatch queue
```

**Architecture details:** [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Repository Layout

```text

├── superharness            # thin command dispatcher

```

## Security Note

The background watcher enables **unattended execution** (agents run without human supervision). This is powerful but requires explicit confirmation:

```bash
bash scripts/install-launchd-inbox-watcher.sh \
  --project /path/to/project \
  --interval 30 \
  --confirm-non-interactive yes \
  --confirm-skip-permissions yes
```

## Current Version

Current execution maturity target: **v0.7** (reliability and adoption milestone)

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for details, [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md) for release notes, and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full iteration log.
